## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- 8GB+ RAM (for model training)
- 10GB+ free disk space

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical-ai-chatbot.git
   cd medical-ai-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download SpaCy model**
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   ```

## 🧠 Model Training

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

The easiest way to train the model is using Google Colab:

1. **Open `collab.py`** - This file contains all training code in 7 parts
2. **Upload to Google Colab** - Copy each part into separate cells
3. **Follow the training process**:
   - Part 1: Data loading and preprocessing
   - Part 2: Text preprocessing with SpaCy
   - Part 3: Embedding generation with sentence-transformers
   - Part 4: FAISS index creation
   - Part 5: Topic modeling with LDA
   - Part 6: Model evaluation and testing
   - Part 7: Save all trained artifacts

4. **Download trained files**:
   - `patient_faiss_index.bin`
   - `description_faiss_index.bin`
   - `medical_chatbot_metadata.pkl`
   - `medical_chatbot_metadata.json`
   - `patient_embeddings.npy`
   - `description_embeddings.npy`
   - `topic_model.pkl`
   - `processed_dataset.csv`

5. **Create models directory** and place all files there:
   ```bash
   mkdir models
   # Move all downloaded files to models/ directory
   ```

### Option 2: Local Training

If you have sufficient resources locally:

1. **Prepare your dataset**:
   - Place your CSV file in `DataSet/` directory
   - Ensure it has `Description`, `Patient`, and `Doctor` columns

2. **Run preprocessing**:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

3. **Train the model**:
   ```bash
   python collab.py
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. **Start the FastAPI server**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Start chatting** with the medical AI!

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file for configuration:

```env
# Application Settings
DEBUG=False
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8000
```

### Model Configuration

The chatbot uses these key parameters:

- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.6 (60% minimum confidence)
- **Top K Results**: 5 (number of similar matches to consider)
- **Embedding Model**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers)
- **NLP Model**: `en_core_web_sm` (SpaCy)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Medical Query
```
User: "I have a headache and fever"
AI: "Headache with fever can indicate various conditions. It's important to monitor your temperature and symptoms. If the fever is high (>101°F) or persists for more than 3 days, consult a healthcare professional..."
```

### Casual Conversation
```
User: "Hi"
AI: "Hello! I'm MedAI, your medical assistant. How can I help you with your health questions today?"
```

### Emergency Guidance
```
User: "I have chest pain"
AI: "Chest pain can be serious. If you're experiencing severe chest pain, pressure, or discomfort, call 108 immediately or go to the nearest emergency room..."
```
